## PROGRAMMING STACK AND DEPENDENCIES
The source code for this program will be divided into three templates: The **front-end**, **API** and **Backend**. The HTML and CSS buildups are already underway. We may consider a react framework for the frontend and node.js for the backend, or perhaps, python Django/Flask. Decisions are still underway.
